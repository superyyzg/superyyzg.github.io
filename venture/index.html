<br>
<font color="#800080">Our theoretical analysis reveals the advantage of L0-Sparse Subspace Clustering (L0-SSC) on noisy data in terms of subspace affinity over 
other competing SSC methods, and proposes provable random projection based methods to accelerate noisy L0-SSC.

<br>
<font color="#800080">Our work analyzes the generalization error of similarity-based classification by Rademacher complexity on an augmented RKHS, where a general similairty function, which is not necessarily a PSD kernel, can be decomposed into
two PSD kernels. Such similarity-based classification is then applied to data clustering in an unsupervised manner (by joint optimization of class labels and classifer parameters).

The key points in the talk are: 
<ol>
<li>Goal of subspace clustering <br></li>
<li>Block-diagonal similarity matrix (where similarity between data from different subspaces vanishes) due to the Subspace Detection Property (SDP). Partitioning data according to their subspace structure is performed by clustering the data with the similarity matrix (spectral clustering in this work).<br></li>
<li>Existing SSC method achieves SDP under various assumptions on the subspaces and data, such as ingradius and subspace incoherence. L0-SSC achieves SDP almost surely under much milder assumptions (Thm .1)  <br></li>
<li>No free lunch and no better deal: suppose there is a linear representation of data that satisfies SDP, then the optimal solution to L0 sparse representation problem can be obtained almost surely from it in polynomial time. (Thm. 2) <br></li>
<li>Therefore, almost surely equivalence between L0-sparsity and SDP is established for the first time. <br></li>
<li>Using proximal gradient descent (PGD) for the optimization problem of L0-SSC, with guarantee of convergence (Prop. 1). Moreover, the obtained sub-optimal solution
 is close to the globally optimal solution (Thm. 3). <br></li>
<li>Property of support shrinkage during the iterations of PGD (Prop. 2). This property is used to significantly reduce the computational burden of the optimization.</li>

Partitioning data according to their subspace structure is performed by clustering the data with the similarity matrix (spectral clustering in this work).<br></li>
<li>Existing SSC method achieves SDP under various assumptions on the subspaces and data, such as ingradius and subspace incoherence. L0-SSC achieves SDP almost surely under much milder assumptions (Thm .1)  <br></li>
<li>No free lunch and no better deal: suppose there is a linear representation of data that satisfies SDP, then the optimal solution to L0 sparse representation problem can be obtained almost surely from it in polynomial time. (Thm. 2) <br></li>
<li>Therefore, almost surely equivalence between L0-sparsity and SDP is established for the first time. <br></li>
<li>Using proximal gradient descent (PGD) for the optimization problem of L0-SSC, with guarantee of convergence (Prop. 1). Moreover, the obtained sub-optimal solution
 is close to the globally optimal solution (Thm. 3). <br></li>
<li>Property of support shrinkage during the iterations of PGD (Prop. 2). This property is used to significantly reduce the computational burden of the optimization.</li>

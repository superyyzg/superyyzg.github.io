<br><strong>About me</strong><br><br>
I am an assistant professor at Arizona State University (staring in Fall 2019). My research covers
	statistical machine learning, deep learning, optimization and theoretical computer science.
	
<br><br><strong><font color="#FF0000">Open Positions</font></strong><br><br>
I am always looking for self-motivated students. Two PhD research assistantships are available, and students with backgound in 
<strong><font color="#FF0000">deep learning or machine learning and optimization</font></strong> are highly encouraged to apply. If you would like to work with me, please 
send your CV to yingzhen.yang@asu.com with a brief introduction to your research interest and the projects/directions that mostly 
interest you. Undergraduate students with said background and strong programming skills are also welcome to conduct research in my group.

"Nothing is more practical than a good theory." --Vladimir Vapnik <br><br>


I am mostly interested in theoretical computer science and different aspects of mathematics, especially functional analysis and geometry. From time to time I contribute to 
statistical machine learning theory, including theory and application of deep learning, subspace learning, manifold learning, sparse representation and compressive sensing, 
nonparametric models, probabilistic graphical models and generalization analysis of classification, semi-supervised learning and clustering; I also deveote efforts to 
optimization theory for machine learning.

<!--
My research focuses on machine learning and deep learning, and I am interested in the combination of conventional statistical machine learning and deep learning so as to design
understandable architecure for deep learning. My research covers theory and application of deep learning including model compression and generalziation, subspace learning, 
manifold learning, sparse representation and compressive sensing, nonparametric models, probabilistic graphical models and generalization analysis of classification, 
semi-supervised learning and clustering; I also deveote efforts to optimization theory for important optimization problems involved in my research, especially for 
sparse regression problems and the optimizatino of deep learning.
